# BankingSystem
Simple banking system for Springboard Python OOP mini-project

The Bank class is responsible for initializing the entire simulation
Some sample information is given to show a user the appropriate datatypes to be entering

A bank account instance is initialized, which in turn creates a Customer and Account instances.
Those require a user to enter information for name, id, and how much money should start in the account

Then bank class allows the user to view their balance, deposit funds, withdraw funds, or exit
This runs in a loop until the user explicitly exits

Trying to remove too much funds will result in an error.

After exiting the session, a new table is printed to show that the banking system's database is updated 
with respect to the new customer we have added.
